# twitchtv-api
My take on the Twitchtv JSON API project from freeCodeCamp.

The objective of the project is to build an app using the Twitch API that will allow the user to see if freeCodeCamp is currently streaming as well as additional stream details. The user should also be able to click and be taken to the fCC Twitch channel.

This project is still a Work in Progress at this point.

Things that still need to be done include:
- add necessary JS/jQuery to access Twitch API
- add necessary JS/JQuery to display API data.
- add functionality to status buttons.
- add functionality to search bar.
- add media queries and finalize layout design.
