# Twitch Streamer Tracker

This application tracks Twitch streamers and displays which of them are currently streaming along with the game they are playing and how many people are watching.

## Motivation

This project was created as part of the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Certification. You can find more information on the parameters for this project in [this fCC post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api). Check out my blog [Regularly Scheduled Programming](https://scheduledprogramming.com/project-twitch-api-part-1/) to learn more about the story behind this project.

## Features

- Displays a list of Twitch streamers
- Streamers who are live have a green background, streamers who are offline have a pinkish background
- The user can click on a streamer's information to be taken directly to their Twitch channel
- Live streams also include information as to the game being play, the stream title, and the number of viewers
- The list of streamers can be sorted by all, online or offline

## Future Improvements
