# twitchtv-api
My take on the Twitch.tv JSON API project from freeCodeCamp.

The objective of the project is to build an app using the Twitch API that will allow the user to see if freeCodeCamp or other streamers are currently streaming. The user should be able to see additional details for streams that are live and should be able to click to go to the streamers Twitch.tv channel.
