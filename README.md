# twitchtv-api
My take on the Twitch.tv JSON API project from freeCodeCamp.

The objective of the project is to build an app using the Twitch API that will allow the user to see if freeCodeCamp or other streamers are currently streaming. The user should be able to see additional details for streams that are live and should be able to click to go to the streamers Twitch.tv channel.

This project is still a Work in Progress at this point.

Things that still need to be done include:
- sort results so that live channels show up before offline channels in the all tab.
- add media queries and finalize layout design.
